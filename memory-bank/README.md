## 📋 **USAGE EXAMPLES**

### **Example 1: New Developer Joining Project**
```markdown
1. Read activeContext.md → "Currently working on 405 error investigation"
2. Read progress.md → "Phase 2 complete, Phase 3 ready to start"  
3. Read systemPatterns.md → "Use hybrid API + database pattern"
4. Read techContext.md → "Python 3.8+, MySQL, GraphQL, Splynx REST API"
Result: Complete understanding in 15 minutes
```

### **Example 2: Returning After Break**
```markdown
1. Check activeContext.md → "Investigation complete, ready for Phase 3"
2. Check progress.md → "40% project complete, core migration engine next"
3. Review systemPatterns.md → "Hybrid pattern proven and documented"
Result: Immediate continuation without context loss
```

### **Example 3: Technical Decision Needed**
```markdown
1. Check systemPatterns.md → "Similar pattern already solved"
2. Check techContext.md → "Technology choice precedent exists"
3. Apply existing pattern → "No need to re-investigate"
Result: Faster development using established knowledge
```

## 🚀 **SUCCESS INDICATORS**

### **Memory Bank is Working When:**
- New developers understand project context in < 30 minutes
- Technical decisions reference established patterns
- Progress tracking shows consistent velocity
- Context switches happen without knowledge loss
- Previous investigations aren't repeated

### **Memory Bank Needs Attention When:**
- Files have outdated information
- New developers struggle to understand current state
- Previous solutions are being re-investigated
- Technical decisions lack historical context
- Progress tracking is behind reality
